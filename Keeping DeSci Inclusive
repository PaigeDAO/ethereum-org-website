Add to further DeSci Reading - highlighting the entire ecosystem of builders including female founders of DeSci DAOs (I am the first with the founding of FrontierDAO)

I'd like to add this explanation of DeSci to the further reading section of the DeSci page. It is written for general audiences rather than specialized blockchain-literate or science audiences. As DeSci (and Open Science) gain traction, I feel it's important to be inclusive in our language and messaging, too.

Describe the solution you'd like

This is primarily an audio piece. The accompanying article is just a brief summary of DeSci and the contents of the audio. The piece focuses on blockchain tooling for scientific publishing. When this was published, over a year ago, my protocol build, Frontier Registry, was the first of its kind in scientific publishing. Today there are several very similar projects released by billionaires and ivy Leagues.
Frontier Registry remains the first IP NFT minted on-chain. Other orgs (like Molecule) take credit for being the first to create an IP NFT but to date they cannot demonstrate that distinction by producing an artifact earlier than my IP NFT of Frontier Registry minted HERE:

Describe alternatives you've considered
I suppose the alternative is to continue to leave out this more inclusive messaging about DeSci. It is a shame to call ourselves decentralized but mimic the past transgressions of leaving out worthy voices and contributions from underrepresented groups.

Describe the solution you'd like

I would like to see more inclusion and recognition of our entire DeSci ecosystem in these pages. There is a huge diversity of participants who have pioneered this movement, including myself who happens to be a woman. I really don't see how we can call ourselves 'decentralized' if the same people and the same names keep being highlighted for recognition and credit for things that, in many cases, other people have done first. In my understanding decentralized means the opposite of centralized. Please correct me if I'm mistaken in this definition?
